     <h2>1. Cyber Hygiene for cyber space</h2>
     <p>Regular Software Updates: Keep all software, including operating systems, web browsers, and applications, up to date with the latest security patches and updates. Regularly applying patches helps protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits.</p>
     <p>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.</p>
     <h3>2. Financial Fraud</h3>
     <p>Identity Theft: Identity theft involves stealing personal information, such as Social Security numbers, credit card details, or bank account information, to impersonate individuals or access their financial accounts without authorization.</p>
     <p>Credit Card Fraud: Credit card fraud occurs when unauthorized transactions are made using someone else's credit card information. This can involve physical theft of cards, card skimming at ATMs or point-of-sale terminals, or online theft through phishing or data breaches.</p>
     <h4>3. Job Fraud</h4>
     <p>Advance Fee Scams: In advance fee scams, fraudsters pose as recruiters or employers offering attractive job opportunities. They may request payment upfront for supposed expenses such as application fees, training materials, background checks, or visa processing. After receiving the payment, the fraudsters disappear, and the promised job never materializes.</p>
     <p>Work-from-Home Scams: Work-from-home scams lure individuals with promises of easy money and flexible hours. These schemes often involve fraudulent job postings for tasks such as envelope stuffing, processing payments, or assembling products from home. Victims may be required to pay for startup kits or training materials, only to discover that the work is nonexistent or poorly compensated.</p>
     <h5>4. Matrimonial fraud</h5>
     <p>Romance Scams: Romance scams typically begin on online dating websites or social media platforms, where fraudsters create fake profiles to establish romantic relationships with unsuspecting individuals. They build trust and affection over time before fabricating stories to request money for various reasons, such as medical emergencies, travel expenses, or financial difficulties. Once the victim sends money, the fraudster disappears or continues to extort funds.</p>
     <p>Green Card or Visa Fraud: In some cases, individuals may enter into sham marriages with foreign nationals solely for the purpose of obtaining residency, citizenship, or immigration benefits. The fraudster may promise marriage or a romantic relationship in exchange for financial compensation or other incentives, without genuine intentions of forming a lasting partnership.</p>
